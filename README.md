### Introduction

### Implementation note

### Quick start guide

The basic usage of remedata is to create custom Express routing handlers which allow the automatic loading of one 
or more files, which then can be treated, though CRUD operations, as in-memory tables and consecutively saved back to
disk. So a GET method correspond to a READ, a PUT to a WRITE etc.

LetÂ´s take a look in more detail. In the following examples we presume that we load the library like this:
 
    var mdata = require('remedata'); // or ..
    import * as mdata from 'remedata'; // ES6
     
Two basic forms are supported: 

     app.get('/test/readuser1', mdata.toread('./json/test1.json'));

'toread' returns a ready made routing handler which reads the specified filed (s) and returns them as the service response.
     
     app.get('/test/readuser2', mdata.toread('./json/test1.json', 
         function(data, req, res){
    
            var result = mycomplexfunction(data, req.query['parameterx']);
            return result;
     }));
  
'toread' defined with a callback allows for the manipulation of the data to be returned to the client. Remedata supports a small but complete
set of operations to manipulate, sort and filter the data-sets. Sort and filter are compatible with the ExtJS Grid.   

     app.post('/test/writeuser1', mdata.towrite('./json/test2.json'));
  
For POST, PUT and DELETE 'towrite' can be used. On its basic form it writes the data send in the request body to the specified file  
 
     app.post('/test/writeuser2', mdata.towrite('./json/test2.json', 
           function(data, newdata, save, req, res){
       
           var record = mdata.insert(newdata, data);
           save(data);
           return record;
     }));
